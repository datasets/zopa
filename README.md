Data on interest rate and risk (default rates) at ZOPA, the peer-to-peer marketplace for money.

### Data

Downloaded directly from ZOPA's website (see home page url).

* Expected Lifetime Bad Debt Rate - the prediction for bad debt in the lifetime of the loan per market
* Expected Annual Bad Debt Rate - the prediction for bad debt, annualised to determine impact on annual return
* Loan Value in Market - the total value of loans within each market
* Loans in Arrears - the value of loans currently going through the arrears collections process - these may reduce with borrower payments
* Defaults and arrears: assumes 50% of arrears are recovered
* Defaulted Loans - the value of loans that have gone through the arrears collection process, and have now been purchased by our collections agency

Bad debt rates for all time are estimated ('expected').

### Openness: Open (?)

Data is publicly available on their website and no explicit restrictions are stated but there is also no explicit license.
